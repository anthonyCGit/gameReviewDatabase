Our project used phpMyAdmin and ICECoder on a lamp-vm to display the UI and handle the database.

Run a lamp-vm with the lastest versions of phpyMyAdmin and ICEcoder installed.
Set up a user with username: 'testuser' and password 'mypassword'.
Import gamereview.sql into phpMyAdmin with default settings.
Place the frontend code in the "project" folder into a "/[ROOT]/project" folder in ICECoder.
Right, click and open the index as a webpage.
